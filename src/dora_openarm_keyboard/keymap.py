"""Key bindings for keyboard teleoperation.

Each arm has its own motion and gripper keys, so both can be driven at the
same time without selecting one first.  Shift is a momentary modifier: while
it is held, the motion keys drive their rotation axis instead of their
translation axis, and releasing it always returns to translation.
